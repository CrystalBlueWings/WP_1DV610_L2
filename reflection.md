# Reflection on Code Quality

During the development of the `SudokuSolver module`, I applied principles from *Clean Code* to ensure that the code is readable, well-structured, and reusable. One of my goals was to adhere to the principle that "classes should represent a single responsibility" (Chapter 2), resulting in a clear separation between classes like `SudokuSolver`, `SudokuGrid`, and `SudokuValidator`.

By giving methods descriptive names, such as `getCellsWithFewestCandidates` and `solveSpecificBox`, I aimed to make the code self-documenting, as also recommended in Chapter 2. This approach improves readability and makes it easy for other developers to understand the purpose of each function.

I also reflected on the principle of small functions (Chapter 3). Some methods, like `#solveBox`, adhere well to this principle by focusing on solving the Sudoku puzzle. Others, such as `#solvePuzzle`, could be refactored to reduce complexity and the number of responsibilities.

Overall, I am satisfied with how the code is structured, but there is room for improvement in further breaking down certain methods and clarifying variable names in accordance with *Clean Code* principles.

# Code Quality Requirements

## Naming Conventions (Chapter 2 of Clean Code)

| Name and Explanation                   | Reflection and Rules from Clean Code                                                  |
|----------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `generateCompleteSudokuGrid`           | **Method Names**: Clear and descriptive of its purpose. Consistent naming convention. |
| `generateUnfinishedSudokuGrid`         | **Avoid Disinformation**: Name clearly indicates that it generates an incomplete sudoku puzzle grid. |
| `getHintForCell`                       | **Don't Be Cute**: The name directly conveys the method’s purpose—providing a hint for a specific cell. The name is not playful and is easy to understand.   |
| `checkIfCanPlaceNumber`                | **Use Problem Domain Names**: Relates directly to the domain, checking if a number can be placed in the grid. |
| `countSolutions`                       | **Use Pronounceable Names**: Simple and clear, indicating that it counts the number of solutions for a grid. |
| `removeNumbersFromGrid`                | **Descriptive and Pronounceable**: Name is self-explanatory, clearly stating its purpose of removing numbers from the grid. |

*Reflection*: The naming in the public interface aligns well with the rules from Clean Code, aiming for clarity and avoiding disinformation or ambiguity.

### Functions Analysis (Chapter 3 of Clean Code)

| Function Name                       | Lines of Code | Reflection on Clean Code Rules                                                                                             |
|-------------------------------------|---------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `#solveGridInternal`                | ~6            | **Do One Thing**: This method focuses on solving the Sudoku puzzle using backtracking. It follows a single purpose well. Could probably further break down the recursion logic to smaller helper methods if needed. |
| `#removeNumbersFromGrid`            | ~19           | **Minimize Control Statements**: This method handles removing numbers to generate an unfinished grid while ensuring uniqueness. Nested conditions add complexity. Should probably refactor validation logic to separate methods to improve readability. |
| `#generateUnfinishedGridWithUniqueSolution` | ~16   | **Function Arguments & Clarity**: This method ensures that the generated unfinished grid has a unique solution. The multiple responsibilities—handling grid generation, timing, and validation—make it complex. Separating timeout checks from grid creation could maybe enhance clarity. |
| `#getCellsRankedByCandidates`       | ~5            | **Small Functions**: The method retrieves all empty cells and ranks them based on the number of candidates. It's simple and adheres well to "Do One Thing." No improvements needed for now. |
| `#findFirstValidNumber`             | ~10           | **Descriptive Names**: The name clearly states the purpose of finding the first valid number for a cell. The function is concise, and the logic is straightforward, making it easy to maintain. No major improvements needed. |
| `#countSolutionsInternal`           | ~9            | **Clear Intent**: The function recursively counts solutions for a grid, handling complex logic. Could probably break down the recursion logic to helper functions to separate counting and validation processes. |
